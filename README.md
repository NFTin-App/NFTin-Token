in-App tokenomic
Our app is built around earning a user rating. Each comment or like received by a user turns into 1 rating point, and the rating * 0.0001 equals the user coefficient, which is used to calculate the tokens received and spent. The higher the user's rating and NFT, the more tokens he can receive.
When you register you will receive 10 tokens, which you can spend on:
Post new NFTs (1 token * per your coefficient)
Leave comments or likes (1 token + NFT rating / 100)
You can do no more than 24 actions per day.
Every day you get:
0.01 * NFT rating to which you left a comment or like
1 * to the coefficient of the user, who left you or your NFT comment or like
When you place a new NFT, the number of coins you receive is multiplied by 2 times. You can get no more than 100 tokens per day.
